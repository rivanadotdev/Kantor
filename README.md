> UI Framework built using [Hybrids](hybrids.js.org/) aimed for assisting **_admin-page_** builders.

## But why ?

Yes, why ? we have [React](), [Vue](), [Solid](), [Astro](), [Svelte](), [Angular](), and many more \*-the list goes on and we doesn't have the energy to mention every single `front-end frameworks` out there.

But one day, as we _-the initial contributors-_ hangout and chat, we apparently found a case where we have different projects with different frameworks but need the same component... `<SocialMediaButtons>`.

Yes, most frameworks has that component and it's not that hard to build one ourselves, but as we are `self-proclaimed-programmers` we are lazy. We are **so lazy** that we decided to build our own **UI Framework-ish using web component**.
